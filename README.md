# simple_interval_timer

MIT license blah blah blah IDGAF

this is a very simple timer that I use for cooking and workouts.  input the number of seconds and hit start, it will run and beep until you hit stop. 

I cannot believe this still doesn't exist as a function of the android clock so I finally just wrote one. 

I spent more time trying to find an interval timer on the play store than it took to write it. 

run it from here:

or save it locally if you want to edit it at all and just open index.html in your browser. 

or fork it and rehost on your own gh pages.
