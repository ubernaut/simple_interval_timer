# simple_interval_timer

MIT license blah blah blah 

A very simple timer that I use for cooking and workouts.  Input the number of seconds and hit start, it will run and beep until you hit stop. 

It tries to keep your screen awake so you can see the count.

run it from here:

It's a PWA so you can install it locally. 

or save it locally if you want to edit it at all and just open index.html in your browser. 

or fork it and rehost on your own gh pages.

I cannot believe this still doesn't exist as a function of the android clock so I finally wrote one.
